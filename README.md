# Sorting_visualizer
Overview
The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to visually demonstrate various sorting algorithms. It provides a real-time visualization of how different sorting algorithms rearrange elements within an array, aiding in understanding their operations and efficiency.

Features
Algorithm Visualization: Display sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort) in action, showcasing their step-by-step operations.
User Interaction: Allow users to adjust array size, sorting speed, and select different algorithms for visualization.
Real-time Animation: Dynamically update the visual representation of the sorting process for educational purposes.
Technologies Used
HTML/CSS: Structure and style the web interface.
JavaScript: Implement sorting algorithms and handle user interactions.
Responsive Design: Ensure compatibility and responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes.
Supported Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Selection Sort: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted sublist and the unsorted sublist.
Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
How to Use
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open index.html: Open the index.html file in your web browser to launch the sorting visualizer.
Interact with Controls: Use the controls provided to select sorting algorithms, adjust array size, and sorting speed.
Visualize Sorting: Click 'Sort' to visualize the selected sorting algorithm in action.
Purpose
The Sorting Visualizer serves as an educational tool for understanding various sorting algorithms. It enables users to interactively visualize and comprehend how different algorithms function and their comparative efficiency in sorting elements.
